        I graduated with an Animation degree from Northumbria University (2020-2023), where I developed a deep 
        understanding of the principles of game development, 3D modeling, and animation. Throughout my academic 
        journey, I honed my technical and creative skills using industry-standard software such as Autodesk Maya, 
        Blender, Unreal Engine, Houdini, Cinema 4D, Substance Painter, and the Adobe Suite. These tools allowed me 
        to refine my expertise in 3D modeling, texturing, animation, and game engine integration, giving me the 
        ability to create immersive, high-quality visual assets. Additionally, I gained experience in programming 
        with Python and C++, applying these languages to automate and streamline workflows in Maya and Blender. I 
        developed custom tools and scripts that helped artists improve efficiency, optimized asset pipelines, and 
        contributed to creating plugins that enhanced the overall performance of the software. This combination 
        of artistic skills and technical programming knowledge has enabled me to bridge the gap between creative 
        design and technical implementation, making me proficient in both aspects of the production pipeline.

        I have made great progress in my pursuit of software development and DevSecOps over the last few months, committing
        to lifelong learning via online resources and self-study.  Acknowledging the increasing significance of security
        in contemporary development, I have actively investigated cloud security, automation, and secure coding techniques, 
        expanding my knowledge of how to create robust and effective systems.

        I was born in Ontario, Canada, but I've lived between Newcastle and Durham my entire life, and it's in these 
        places that I feel like I belong. Because of Newcastle's lively spirit, extensive history, and friendly 
        locals, I've grown to love the city. I've always been inspired by the city's distinctive fusion of contemporary 
        urban life, Georgian architecture, and its indisputable link to the River Tyne. The city 
        has influenced who I am in ways that words cannot adequately express, whether I'm walking down Grey Street, 
        taking in the classic cosiness of a pub, or taking in the grandeur of Newcastle Castle. Newcastle feels like 
        home because of its sense of community, local pride, and creative energy, all of which I'm thankful to call it my own.
